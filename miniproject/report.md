I GOT MY DATA FROM KAGGLE, AND IT CONSISTED OF HOME PRICES, THE YEAR OF THE SALE, AND SALARY OF PEOPLE WITHIN THE UK
I WANTED TO PREDICT HOUSING PRICES BASED ON SALARY AND THE YEAR OF THE SALE
MY TARGET VARIABLE WAS HOUSE PRICE AND KEY PREDICTORS WERE THE YEAR AND SALARY OF THE PERSON
I CLEANED MY DATA BY REMOVING NULL VALUES IN AVERAGE SALARY, THAT WAS ALL MY DATASET REQUIRED
THIS DATA WAS TRAINED BY USING THE TRAINING DATASET AND THEN A QUICKBUILD WAS PRODUCED 
THIS MODEL PERFORMED WELL, ACCURACY WAS AT 93% BUT COULD HAVE BEEN IMPROVED IF THERE WERE MORE VARIABLES INVOVLED IN THE prediction
